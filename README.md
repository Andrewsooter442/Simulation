# How the project is structured 
The methods are stored in the helper folder (For now only the adaptive_gauss_kronrod.c is usefull)

In the base directory there are tests which can be run to test the method on functions.
More functions can be added or removed.


### How to run
#### On mac and linux.

```gcc test.c -o prog.out && ./prog.out```
